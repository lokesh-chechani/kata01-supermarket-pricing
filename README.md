## Design Pattern
Clean code and SOLID principal.
[S.O.L.I.D principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))

It is based on the test-first concept of Extreme Programming (XP) that encourages simple design with high level of confidence.
[TDD](https://technologyconversations.com/2014/09/30/test-driven-development-tdd/)

The procedure of doing TDD is following:

- Write a test
- Run all tests
- Write the implementation code
- Run all tests
- Refactor

## Branching model
The branching model used is [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
